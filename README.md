## 🧠 Simulation Theory

Lucidia Metaverse embeds **Simulation Theory** directly into the experience — the idea that our perceived reality may itself be a computational construct.

### What you'll find in-world

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Simulation Core** | A pulsing wireframe icosahedron floating above the city — the origin node of the simulation |
| **Simulation Boundary** | A translucent wireframe sphere enclosing the core, representing the outer edge of observable reality |
| **Matrix Rain** | Cascading green data particles falling across the world, visualising the raw code beneath the surface |

### The concept

> *"If a civilisation ever reaches the point where it can run large numbers of high-fidelity simulations of minds, the simulated minds would vastly outnumber biological ones."* — Nick Bostrom, 2003

Three testable markers hidden in the metaverse hint at the simulation hypothesis:

1. **Quantised geometry** — all terrain is discretised on a grid, just as spacetime may be at the Planck scale
2. **Render budget** — only 50 buildings and 10 islands are ever generated; the rest is void, consistent with a lazy-loading universe
3. **The Core** — seek the green icosahedron above the city. Touching it triggers a cascade of system messages revealing the simulation's seed
